# Power-Bi-Portfolio-Projects
Student performance dashboard is one of the portfolio project I did. It is designed to provide insights into the academic performance of students across various subjects. This interactive dashboard allows educators and administrators to visualize key metrics such as average scores, grade distribution, individual student performance, and more. The goal is to empower decision-makers with data-driven insights to enhance educational outcomes.
#Key insights:
-Studenst grades breakdown using pie chart.
-Total enrollment of students number by date using line chart.
-Different payment methods by using bar stacked chart.
-Individual insight on student can be done by using search bar that I created using slicer.
